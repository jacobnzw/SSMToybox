# SSM Toybox
Python 3 implementation of the nonlinear sigma-point filters based on Gaussian process quadrature. Included are also the well-known classical nonlinear Kalman filters such as:

* Extended Kalman Filter
* Unscented Kalman Filter
* Cubature Kalman Filter
* Gauss-Hermite Kalman Filter

## Structure

`StateSpaceInference`

`StateSpaceModel`

`MomentTransform`


## Why toybox?
Because 'toolbox' sounds too serious and, at least to me, implies certain standard of quality, which this code is lacking at this moment.
